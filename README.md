- 👋 Hi, I’m @Phoenox (aka Thomas Eggerling), a C# software developer living in Karlsruhe.
- 👀 I’m interested in development of desktop applications using Clean Code, although I also dabbled in soft realtime algorithms.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Blazor and taking a hike in web development in general.
- 💞️ I'm a firm advocate of clean code development. Check out this site if you'd like to know more: https://clean-code-developer.com
- 📫 You can reach me via mail.  
Here's a little test of your sentience:  
take each segment of the following email address, and reverse it (e.g. oof.alb@rab.zab would become foo.bla@bar.baz):  
samoht.gnilregge@oetsop.ed.
