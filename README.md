- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Phoenox (aka Thomas Eggerling), a C# software developer living in Karlsruhe.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in development of desktop applications using Clean Code, although I also dabbled in soft realtime algorithms.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Blazor and taking a hike in web development in general.
- ğŸ“« You can reach me via mail.  
Here's a little test of your sentience:  
take each segment of the following email address, and reverse it (e.g. oof.alb@rab.zab would become foo.bla@bar.baz):  
samoht.gnilregge@oetsop.ed.
