- 👋 Hi, I’m @Phoenox (aka Thomas Bittner), a C++/C# software developer living in Karlsruhe.
- 👀 I’m interested in development of desktop applications using Clean Code, although I also dabbled in soft realtime algorithms.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Blazor and taking a hike in web development in general.
- 💞️ My current pet project is the development of a software suite aiming to support Pen-and-Paper roleplaying, both online and at the real table. I'm just getting started, so there's not much to see, but if you're interested, check it out: https://github.com/Phoenox/RpgHub
- 📫 You can reach me via mail.  
Here's a little test of your sentience:  
take each segment of the following email address, and reverse it (e.g. oof.alb@rab.zab would become foo.bla@bar.baz):  
samoht.renttib@oetsop.ed.
